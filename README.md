# Bash-Script-Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my little portfolio written in bash script! This was a fun assignment during my internship at 365 Retail Markets.
For this project, I am demonstrating the usage of varaibles, conditionals, and loops in bash scripting.

# How to run bash script:
1. Download the file in the directory of your choice :)
2. In the terminal, enter `bash bashScriptPortfolio.sh` or `./bashScriptPortfolio.sh`

# How it should function:
1. Display welcome message and ask user to give input on if they would like to play
2. If they said yes, it will display a riddle
3. If the answer the user inputs is correct, information about me will display
4. When all riddles are done, contact information will display
